About ardupilot: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardupilot

We are currently using the recently outdated Quad 2013 model for the large quadcopter which has most info available here: http://3drobotics.com/learn/discontinued-products/


* Assembly Instructions
* Frame Kit Assembly Instructions
* Download software
* Show me how to set up battery monitoring (this still needs to be done)
* Show me how to calibrate the ESCs

About altimeter built into APM 2.6 and Crazyflie (after testing done we have noticed it will fluctuate 1 to 2 meters over the course of a minute or two so is unreliable indoors if you plan to make an altitude based PID controller): http://www.meas-spec.com/downloads/MS5611-01BA03.pdf

Crazyflie
The mathematica_control and matlab_control folders on github hold the files for deriving and testing simulink model of a quadcopter based on the quadcopter used in Bouabdallah’s thesis (which is included in the repository)


When running Matlab scripts or Simulink you will need to have installed Matlab as well which can be downloaded from CMU: http://www.cmu.edu/computing/software/all/matlab/


Mathematica was used in deriving a linear controller to replace the PID controller on the Crazyflie (yet to be done): http://www.cmu.edu/computing/software/all/mathematica/index.html
